This video was generated using Unity's Cinemachine. It shows someone entering the art studio of an artist who is prototyping with an augmented reality app such as the [Tapgaze mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tapgaze/id1534427791).

The video was generated as part of the [Tapgaze App's](https://tapgaze.com/) marketing campaign.

To develop this WebGL app I used Unity3D, Unity Cinemachine, imported and setup animations into Unity, 3D Modelling in Maya, texturing in Substance Painter and Mudbox, Photoshop CC.

Modelled and textured in-house except for the characters.

Watch the result:
