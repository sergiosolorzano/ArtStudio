I re-created a ceramist client studio (MudMud Studio) as a video game by modelling and texturing all 3D models. Simiarly to a computer game, you can walk around the ceramist studio. I prepared this project to test WebGL and Unity as a marketing channel for augmented reality apps of a studio I later setup in 2019.

The night sky shows a celestial void formed by the convergence of unity animated particles. The scene is built on Unity, exported as a WebGL application, hosted on Azure and playable on browser.

In this game scene, I created the scene, game mechanics, 3D models, textures and vortex particles.

**App is not supported on mobile, only works on PC/Mac**
Web-app has been tested on PC and MacOS systems, Chrome and Firefox browsers.
